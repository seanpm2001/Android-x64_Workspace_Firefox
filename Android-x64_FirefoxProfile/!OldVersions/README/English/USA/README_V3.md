## Profile wipes

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

### 2022 December 23rd profile wipe

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this sub-section</b></p></summary>

On 2022, December 23rd, Firefox failed to load the pinned tabs of the profile, and I had to rebuild it in a new way. From now on, I will be making a backup of all tabs of each profile on a daily basis. I never realized how easy it was to double bookmark (select all tabs, bookmark, choose location, save)

This change will significantly add to the volume of the daily backups. I am now protected from this happening again.
