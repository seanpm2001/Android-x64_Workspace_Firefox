# Android x64 Workspace

## Firefox profile tour

### 2022 December 25th

#### Notes

I recorded the tour video in full depth today, with some minor errors in recording (such as some typos in my cursor movements) there are now 2 variants of the tour video: one of the GUI, and one of the bookmarks menu.

For the Firefox video, I again recorded over the Android x64 Internet Archive homepage, as this is the spot for this recording.

I now plan to get a tour video every Sunday (if I can do it during the day) or Monday near Midnight. The recordings seem to be nearing 25 megabytes, so I might stop uploading them here for now if they get too large. Maybe I can partition them into multiple parts.
