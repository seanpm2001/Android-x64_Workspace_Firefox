# Android x64 Workspace

## Firefox profile tour

### 2022 December 12th

#### Notes

This video is a bit sporadic. At certain points, I felt like touring all the bookmarks, at certain points, I didn't. Hopefully I can make a better video tomorrow.

I additionally recorded over the Android x64 Internet Archive account, as it is the cleanest and most consistent place to record this type of video. I feel this will be the page I record every one of these videos on.
